WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   cursor_controller/RESET_write_address[10]_AND_80_o is sourced by a
   combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to
   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   cursor_controller/RESET_write_address[6]_AND_88_o is sourced by a
   combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to
   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
